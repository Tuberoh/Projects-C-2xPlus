Hello there,
these are some of my projects which I've done for school. 
They are simple programs, but useful to revise or to see simple C++ codes for beginners.
Hope you enjoy all the errors...I'm joking, but I think there are some of them in all the codes I've published in this
repository, or maybe not. Anyways, enjoy ヾ(•ω•`)o
